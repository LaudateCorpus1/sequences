The Art of C++ / Sequences is a zero-dependency C++11 header-only library that provides efficient algorithms to generate and work on [`std::integer_sequence`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/integer_sequence).

# Compatibility

* The library support C++11 or newer version.
* On C++11, it provides `tao::seq::integer_sequence` itself.
* On C++14 or better it uses `std::integer_sequence`.
* It is tested with GCC 4.7+ and Clang 3.4+.

More documentation will come soon...
